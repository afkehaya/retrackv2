            <strong>Additional Service Providers</strong>
            </br></br>

            We may use affiliates or contractors to provide certain clerical and information processing and shipping services on our site. When you sign up for our services, we will share only as much information as is necessary for the provision of those services.
            These parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
            Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information
            The security of your personal information is extremely important to us. We employ generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
            Our site uses security technology to protect information you provide to us through the site when entering sensitive information.
            After information reaches Company, it is stored on a secure server that resides behind firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of Company. You can help to maintain the security of your online transactions by not sharing your personal information with anyone. Remember, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. (Example: any information you provide us by email is not encrypted) Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
            If you have any questions about the security on our Web site, please feel free to e-mail us.
            Log Files
            As is true of most Websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data.
            We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.

            We use session ID cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.

            Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)

            </br></br>

            We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.
            We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please contact us.
